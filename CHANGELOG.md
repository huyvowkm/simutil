## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add Device Controls (`c`) for running Android devices and iOS Simulators:
  appearance, text size, and Android locale.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Stop resolving Xcode Derived Data under `/` when `$HOME` is missing; require an explicit home directory and fail clearly instead.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Add confirmation dialog.
- Add Xcode Tools (`x`) with Clear Derived Data — measure size, confirm, then wipe `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` (macOS only).

### Fixed

- Fix background color of some dialogs.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Add first-run Welcome and post-update Changelog dialogs backed by internal app state.

### Changed

- Clarify in the README that iOS simulators and devices require macOS; Linux and Windows support Android only.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Add Linux x64 support to the generated Homebrew formula.
- Add a release install smoke test that verifies packaged binaries before drafting a GitHub Release.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Fix Android ADB discovery on Linux by checking `$HOME/Android/Sdk` and falling back to `adb` on `PATH` when no SDK-managed binary is present.
- Stop treating all Android physical devices as fully booted when `adb devices -l` reports intermediate states such as `unauthorized` or `offline`.
- Restore SSH terminal and TTY state on Linux after quitting remote sessions.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Add custom plugin support via the `plugins:` section of `~/.simutil/settings.yaml`: register external shell-command tools (each with one or more commands) and run them from the app with `p` (plugin → command → execute) or a direct command shortcut, without changing code.
- Add `e` key to open `~/.simutil/settings.yaml` in the OS default editor (macOS, Linux, Windows).

### Changed

- Route plugin availability probes through `CommandExec` instead of calling `Process.run` directly.
- Merge plugin configuration into `~/.simutil/settings.yaml` (settings scalars + `plugins:` section in one file).
- Migrate the built-in scrcpy integration to the YAML plugin registry (a default config with scrcpy is generated on first launch).

### Fixed

- Prevent device refresh from hanging forever when a simulator or device lookup stalls.
- Fix `Device.fromJson` reading the `os` field from the wrong key, which made deserialization always throw.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Add Windows PowerShell installer command (`install.ps1`) to README installation section.

- Refactor Wi-Fi pairing flow to match Android Studio: discover pairing-code endpoints first, require code entry after selecting a discovered device, then resolve and connect to the post-pair ADB connect endpoint.

- Fix text color in dialogs and panels to avoid wrong overlay effect.
